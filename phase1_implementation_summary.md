# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: State Management Refactoring

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Split Context Architecture
- Created three specialized contexts:
  - `UIContext`: Manages UI state (drawing mode, brush size, loading, errors)
  - `CanvasContext`: Manages canvas state (strokes, drawing operations)
  - `AppContext`: Manages application data (images, dimensions, file info)
- Implemented a combined provider (`AllProvidersWrapper`) for easier usage
- Added memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Created custom hooks for accessing each context

### 2. Optimized Save Operation
- Implemented a non-blocking save operation
- Created a temporary canvas for saving to prevent affecting the display
- Added proper error handling and status indicators
- Fixed the image re-rendering issue when saving masks

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers to maintain reference equality
- Implemented `useMemo` for computed values
- Used refs for high-frequency updates that don't need to trigger re-renders
- Optimized stroke handling to reduce render cycles

### 4. Updated Components
- Modified all components to use the new context structure:
  - `App.jsx`: Now uses the combined provider
  - `ImageEditor.jsx`: Split state access across contexts
  - `DrawingCanvas.jsx`: Optimized rendering and event handling
  - `Toolbar.jsx`: Improved save operation and UI feedback
  - `ImageUploader.jsx`: Enhanced file handling

### 5. Updated Tests
- Rewrote tests to work with the new context structure
- Added tests for memoization and performance optimizations
- Updated component tests to verify the new behavior

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders
   - More efficient state updates
   - Better handling of high-frequency operations

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Clearer separation of concerns
   - More maintainable state management
   - Easier to understand component responsibilities

3. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Non-blocking save operations
   - Better visual feedback
   - Smoother drawing experience

4. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - More predictable state updates
   - Easier debugging
   - Better testability

## Next Steps

The next phase will focus on UI Layout Restructuring:
1. Create main layout components
2. Implement tool panel
3. Enhance canvas area

This will build on the solid foundation we've established with the improved state management.
