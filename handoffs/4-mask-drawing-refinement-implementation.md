# Mask Drawing Refinement Implementation Handoff - 2025-03-20

## Summary
Successfully implemented the mask drawing refinement requirements outlined in the previous handoff. This included removing redundant UI elements at the bottom of the screen, updating the brush logic to ensure consistent opacity regardless of layering, and ensuring proper binary mask representation. We also reorganized and improved tests to better verify both functionality and proper code organization.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)
- **HIGH**: Add test documentation for the eraser improvements to ensure future maintenance understands the implementation
- **MEDIUM**: Address the failing mouse and touch event tests in DrawingCanvas.test.jsx
- **LOW**: Consider adding integration tests between canvas drawing and mask generation

## Discoveries
- The previous eraser implementation was not completely removing brush strokes but just making them more transparent
- The binary mask representation was not correctly distinguishing between background black pixels and actual brush strokes
- There was test code scattered in different files that wasn't following the project's structure

## Problems & Solutions
- **Problem**: Eraser functionality was just making strokes more transparent rather than completely removing them
  **Solution**: Updated the draw function to use full opacity (1.0) when in erase mode to completely remove pixels, while keeping globalCompositeOperation as 'destination-out'
  
- **Problem**: Binary mask representation was turning everything into white areas
  **Solution**: Improved the mask generation logic to properly identify brush strokes vs. background:
  ```jsx
  // Convert to binary mask (0 or 255)
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 4) {
    // Check if the pixel is from a brush stroke (non-black with opacity)
    const isStrokePixel = (data[i+3] > 0) && 
                         !(data[i] === 0 && data[i+1] === 0 && data[i+2] === 0);
    
    if (isStrokePixel) {
      // This is a brush stroke area - set to white
      data[i] = 255;    // R
      data[i+1] = 255;  // G
      data[i+2] = 255;  // B
      data[i+3] = 255;  // A
    } else {
      // This is background - set to black
      data[i] = 0;      // R
      data[i+1] = 0;    // G
      data[i+2] = 0;    // B
      data[i+3] = 255;  // A
    }
  }
  ```

- **Problem**: Test organization didn't match the project's structure
  **Solution**: Reorganized tests by moving them to appropriate files that match the structure of the code base

## Work in Progress
- [Phase 1: State Management Refactoring]: 100%
- [Phase 2: UI Layout Restructuring]: 100%
- [Phase 3: Visual Design System]: 100%
- [Phase 4: Mask Drawing Refinement]: 100%

## Deviations
- The Toolbar component was completely removed rather than just modified, with its functionality integrated into the ToolPanel component
- We created new test files for better organization rather than just modifying existing ones
