# Conversation: Visual Design System and Mask Drawing Refinement

## Session Date: 2025-03-20

### Context
This conversation covers the implementation of Phase 3 (Visual Design System) and planning for Phase 4 (Mask Drawing Refinement).

### Key Topics
- Implementation of theme configuration with Chakra UI
- Styling of UI components (ActionButtons, DrawingTools, ToolPanel)
- Test-driven implementation of visual styling
- Planning for mask drawing refinements:
  - Removing redundant UI elements
  - Improving brush stroke consistency
  - Ensuring binary mask representation

### Main Tasks Completed
1. Created theme.js with color palette, typography, and component-specific styling
2. Updated App.jsx to use ChakraProvider with the theme
3. Styled ActionButtons component with tooltips and consistent branding
4. Enhanced DrawingTools with better organization and visual brush preview
5. Updated ToolPanel with cleaner layout and visual hierarchy
6. Created tests for all styled components
7. Created handoff document (3-mask-drawing-refinement.md) for next phase

### Next Steps
1. Remove redundant image editing options at bottom of screen
2. Update brush logic for consistent opacity regardless of layering
3. Ensure mask representation is pure black/white (255 for any brush stroke)
4. Follow Test Driven Design principles for each implementation step
